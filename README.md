This repository is the open-source implementation of the paper "Robust Multimodal Mineral Identification based on a Parameter-Efficient Method".
This project proposes a multimodal mineral identification framework that integrates Scale and Shift Feature Adaptation (SSF) and Dynamic Multimodal Information Bottleneck (DMIB). It addresses issues such as "modality missing" and "modality data errors" in practical geological exploration scenarios. While ensuring identification accuracy, it only introduces a 13.8% increase in parameter volume, making it highly practical and scalable.
